Standalone scripts, of which there is currently only one.

 * blockrenamer &mdash; My personal block renaming script, which I use on pretty much all my builds. Safe to run incrementally, as long as you use the same prefix (i.e. it won't mess with any names you've already customized... as long as the name already starts with the prefix).
